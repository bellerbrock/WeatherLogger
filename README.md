# WeatherLogger
Code for turning a raspberry pi plus sensors into a weather station that logs readings using the Google Sheets API

Original [BME280 python library](https://github.com/cmur2/python-bme280) and [BH1750 library](https://bitbucket.org/MattHawkinsUK/rpispy-misc/raw/master/python/bh1750.py). Credit to [Allan Schwartz's blog](http://www.whatimade.today/log-sensor-data-straight-to-google-sheets-from-a-raspberry-pi-zero-all-the-python-code/) for the idea and the sheets api submission code.
